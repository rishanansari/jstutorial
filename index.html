          <span class="fw-bold">JavaScript</span> is a lightweight, interpreted
          <span class="fw-bold">programming</span> language. It is designed for
          creating network-centric applications. It is complimentary to and
          integrated with Java. <span class="fw-bold">JavaScript</span> is very
          easy to implement because it is integrated with HTML. It is open and
          cross-platform. <br />
          <h2 class="mt-3">Why to learn JavaScript?</h2>
          <span class="fw-bold">JavaScript</span> is a MUST for students and
          working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially
          when they are working in Web Development Domain. I will list down some
          of the key advantages of learning Javascript: <br />
          <ul>
            <li>
              Javascript is the most popular programming language in the world
              and that makes it a programmerâ€™s great choice. Once you learnt
              Javascript, it helps you developing great front-end as well as
              back-end softwares using different Javascript based frameworks
              like jQuery, Node.JS etc.
            </li>
            <li>
              Javascript is everywhere, it comes installed on every modern web
              browser and so to learn Javascript you really do not need any
              special environment setup. For example Chrome, Mozilla Firefox ,
              Safari and every browser you know as of today, supports
              Javascript.
            </li>
            <li>
              Javascript helps you create really beautiful and crazy fast
              websites. You can develop your website with a console like look
              and feel and give your users the best Graphical User Experience.
            </li>
            <li>
              JavaScript usage has now extended to mobile app development,
              desktop app development, and game development. This opens many
              opportunities for you as Javascript Programmer.
            </li>
            <li>
              Due to high demand, there is tons of job growth and high pay for
              those who know JavaScript. You can navigate over to different job
              sites to see what having JavaScript skills looks like in the job
              market.
            </li>
            <li>
              Great thing about Javascript is that you will find tons of
              frameworks and Libraries already developed which can be used
              directly in your software development to reduce your time to
              market.
            </li>
          </ul>

          There could be 1000s of good reasons to learn
          <span class="fw-bold"> Javascript Programming.</span>
          But one thing for sure, to learn any programming language, not only
          Javascript, you just need to code, and code and finally code until you
          become expert.
